Overview
Resume-Screening-AI is an AI-powered tool designed to automatically analyze and screen resumes to help recruiters identify the best candidates quickly and efficiently. The model evaluates key features extracted from resumes such as skills, experience, and qualifications to predict the suitability of a candidate.

How It Works
Data Input: The system receives resumes in a structured format (e.g., CSV or JSON) containing candidate information.

Feature Extraction: Important features like skills, job titles, education, and experience are extracted and transformed into a format suitable for machine learning.

Model Prediction: The processed data is fed into a trained machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) which predicts the candidateâ€™s relevance or suitability score.

Output: The model outputs a classification or ranking to help recruiters filter resumes effectively.

Usage
